<h2>Regex and finite state machines</h2>

<!--  <p>2017-08-22 13:30:00</p> -->

<p><br>
Regular expressions patterns are implemented as finite state machines! I find this pretty cool, and finding this out has helped me to understand both things a bit better. </p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Why is this cool?</h2>
<p>This means that we can:
- find substrings on just one pass through a string, 
- without looking ahead (only knowing about one character at a time),
- while only keeping track of a few extra  variables (or states).</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>What is a finite state machine?</h2>
<p>A finite state machine is just a model for understanding something.  It models something that has different states, and that can only be in one of those states at one time. </p>
<p><br>
For example, a door can either be locked or not locked:
<img alt="An image of two circles: one has 'locked' written inside, and the other has 'unlocked' written inside.  There are two arrows, each pointing from one circle to the other." src="/door_states.png" /></p>
<p><br>
We can add the conditions that cause the state to change:
<img alt="The same image as above, but with labels added to the arrows: 'turn key right' leads to 'unlocked', and 'turn key left' leads to 'locked'." src="/door_states_with_conditions.png" /></p>
<p><br>
A finite state machine is defined by:
- possible states
- conditions that cause transitions between states to occur
- the starting state (if appropriate - the door is always either locked or unlocked, so the diagrams above don't have a separate starting state)</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>A regular expression as a finite state machine</h2>
<p>If I wanted to search a string for substrings that:
- start with <code>a</code>,
- have one or more <code>b</code>'s in the middle,
- and end with <code>c</code>,</p>
<p><br>
I could search for the regex pattern <code>ab+c</code> (where <code>+</code> means the previous character can occur one or more times).</p>
<p><br>
So:
- <code>abc</code>, <code>abbbc</code>, and <code>abbbbbbbbc</code> would all match, 
- but <code>ac</code> and <code>acb</code> wouldn't match.</p>
<p><br>
We can draw this as a finite state machine:
<img alt="Image of a finite state machine with circles representing the states 0, 1, 2, 3, and 'not a match'.  'a' can move us from state 0 to 1, 'b' from state 1 to 2, and 'c' from state 2 to 3.  State 3 is double circled." src="/regex_machine.png" /></p>
<p><br>
Notes:
<em> the double circle shows that state 3 is an end state (ie. if we get to state 3, we have found a match)
</em> some inputs do not cause a change in state (eg. in state 0, any input that is not <code>a</code> causes the state to remain 0)</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Keeping track of states</h2>
<p>If we want to find out if a string (say: <code>aabc</code>) contains our pattern, we will iterate through the string and keep track of our possible states. We'll start out with only one possible states: state 0.  At each character in the string, we will update all possible states with the new input, removing states that <code>do not match</code></p>
<p><br>
We will iterate through each character like this:</p>
<p>Current possible States | Input character | Update possible states 
  ------------- | -------------   | -------------
  0             | <code>a</code>             | 1 
  0, 1          | <code>a</code>             | 1 
  0, 1          | <code>b</code>             | 0, 2
  0, 2          | <code>c</code>             | 0, 3</p>
<p><br>
State 3 is one of our current states, so we know that the string contains our pattern! </p>
<p><br>
If we wanted to find the matching substrings (ie. return the index of each match), we'd have to also keep track of those too. </p>
